A major mode for editing Haskell (the functional programming
language, see URL `http://www.haskell.org') in Emacs.

Some of its major features include:

 - syntax highlighting (font lock),

 - automatic indentation,

 - on-the-fly documentation,

 - interaction with inferior GHCi/Hugs instance,

 - scans declarations and places them in a menu.

See URL `https://github.com/haskell/haskell-mode' and/or

Use `M-x haskell-mode-view-news` (after Haskell Mode is installed)
to show information on recent changes in Haskell Mode.
