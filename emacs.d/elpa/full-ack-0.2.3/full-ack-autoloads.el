(autoload 'ack-same "full-ack" "\
Run ack with --type matching the current `major-mode'.
The types of files searched are determined by `ack-mode-type-alist' and
`ack-mode-extension-alist'.  If no type is configured the buffer's file
extension is used for the search.
PATTERN is interpreted as a regular expression, iff REGEXP is non-nil.  If
called interactively, the value of REGEXP is determined by `ack-search-regexp'.
A prefix arg toggles that value.
DIRECTORY is the root directory.  If called interactively, it is determined by
`ack-project-root-file-patterns'.  The user is only prompted, if
`ack-prompt-for-directory' is set.
